## What is Damas-Hindley-Milner?

A Damas-Hindley-Milner (HM) type system is a type system for the lambda
calculus (later adapted for Standard ML and the ML-family languages) with
parametric polymorphism, aka generic functions. It sits at a sweet spot in PL
design: the type system is quite expressive, and there are well known type
inference algorithms that require absolutely no annotations from the
programmer.

TODO: link to papers from Damas, Hindley, and Milner

The type system is limited, but by virtue of being limited, it confers these
advantages:

* Inference algorithms tend to be fast (roughly O(size of code))
* Something something principal types
* ??? [It's a good type system, reader!](https://stackoverflow.com/a/399392)

<!--As a general note: the more constrained your language/system is, the more you
can optimize-->

In this post, we implement HM two ways, and then extend it a little bit. We'll
do this in the context of [scrapscript](/blog/scrapscript), but the goal is to
get a better understanding of HM in general.

We'll start with Algorithm W because it's the OG, and doesn't depend on side
effects like Algorithm J does. It *is* definitely more visually confusing than
Algorithm J, though, so if you get discouraged, you might want to skip ahead to
Algorithm J.

## The data structures

Every expression has exactly one type, called a monotype (we'll get to
generalization later). For this type checker, instead of working with values,
such as `5`, we're evaluating a program composed of types (`int`) and
operations on types (`list`). For our purposes, a monotype is either a type
variable like `a` or a type constructor like `->`, `list`, etc.

We represent that divide in python with classes:

```python
@dataclasses.dataclass
class MonoType:
    pass


@dataclasses.dataclass
class TyVar(MonoType):
    name: str


@dataclasses.dataclass
class TyCon(MonoType):
    name: str
    args: list[MonoType]
```

A lot of people make HM type inference implementations by hard-coding functions
and other type constructors like `list` as the only type constructors but we
instead model them all in terms of `TyCon`:

```python
IntType = TyCon("int", [])
BoolType = TyCon("bool", [])

def list_type(ty: MonoType) -> MonoType:
    return TyCon("list", [ty])

def func_type(arg: MonoType, ret: MonoType) -> MonoType:
    return TyCon("->", [arg, ret])
```

We'll also have something called a type scheme, which we'll use more later, but
for now is a thin wrapper around a monotype:

```python
@dataclasses.dataclass
class Forall:
    tyvars: list[TyVar]
    ty: MonoType
```

With these, we model the world.

## Algorithm W

Let's start with Algorithm W. It's probably the most famous one (citation
needed) because it was presented in the paper as the easiest to prove correct.
It's also free of side effects, which probably appeals to [Haskell
nerds](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/union-find-array-0.1.0.4/docs/Control-Monad-Union.html).

The idea is that you have a function `infer_w` that takes an expression and an
environment (a "context") and returns a substitution and a type. A substitution
is a mapping from type variables to monotypes and the type is the type of the
expression that you passed in. We'll use the substitution to keep track of
constraints on types as we walk the tree. In Python syntax, that's:

```python
Subst = typing.Mapping[str, MonoType]  # type variable -> monotype
Context = typing.Mapping[str, Forall]  # program variable -> type scheme
def infer_w(expr: Object, ctx: Context) -> tuple[Subst, MonoType]: ...
```

Note that while substitutions map type variables (generated by the inference
engine) to monotypes, contexts map source-level variable names (generated by
you!) to type schemes. For now, think of a type scheme as a superficial wrapper
for a monotype.

The rules of inference are as follows:

* if you see an integer literal
  * return `IntType`
* if you see a variable `e`,
  * look up the scheme of `e` in the environment
  * instantiate the scheme and return it
* if you see a function `e`,
  * invent a new type variable `t` for the parameter, and add it to the
    environment while type checking the body `b` (call that `type(b)`)
  * return a function type from `t` to `type(b)`
* if you see function application `e`,
  * infer the type of callee `f`
  * infer the type of the argument `a`
  * invent a new type variable `r`
  * constrain `type(f)` to be a function from `type(a)` to `r`
  * return `r`
* if you see a let binding `let n = v in b` (called "where" in scrapscript) `e`,
  * infer the type of the value `v`
  * construct a superficial type scheme `s` containing `type(v)`
  * add `n: s` to the environment while type checking the body `b`
  * return `type(b)`

In order to keep the constraints (substitutions) flowing after each recursive
call to `infer_w`, we need to be able to compose substitutions. It's not just a
union of two dictionaries, but instead more like function composition. That's
what `compose`, `apply_ty`, and `apply_ctx` are for.

```python
def compose(s1: Subst, s2: Subst) -> Subst: ...

def apply_ty(ty: MonoType, subst: Subst) -> MonoType: ...

def apply_ctx(ctx: Context, subst: Subst) -> Context: ...
```

This "constrain" process we talked about in the inference rules refers to
*unification*, which we call `unify_w`. In Algorithm W, unification involves
building up a substitution. Type variables are "easy"; bind them to a monotype.
For type constructors, we have to check that the constructor name matches, then
that they each have the same number of arguments, and finally build up
constraints by unifying the arguments pairwise.

. factr = facti ->

  | n -> n * (facti (n - 1))
-->

```python
def unify_w(ty1: MonoType, ty2: MonoType) -> Subst:
    if isinstance(ty1, TyVar):
        return bind_var(ty2, ty1.name)
    if isinstance(ty2, TyVar):  # Mirror
        return unify_w(ty2, ty1)
    if isinstance(ty1, TyCon) and isinstance(ty2, TyCon):
        if ty1.name != ty2.name:
            unify_fail(ty1, ty2)
        if len(ty1.args) != len(ty2.args):
            unify_fail(ty1, ty2)
        result: Subst = {}
        for l, r in zip(ty1.args, ty2.args):
            result = compose(
                unify_w(apply_ty(l, result), apply_ty(r, result)),
                result,
            )
        return result
    raise TypeError(f"Unexpected type {type(ty1)}")
```

Example: `unify_w(...) = blah`

```python
def infer_w(expr: Object, ctx: Context) -> tuple[Subst, MonoType]:
    if isinstance(expr, Var):
        scheme = ctx.get(expr.name)
        if scheme is None:
            raise TypeError(f"Unbound variable {expr.name}")
        return {}, scheme.ty
    if isinstance(expr, Int):
        return {}, IntType
    if isinstance(expr, Function):
        arg_tyvar = fresh_tyvar()
        body_ctx = {**ctx, expr.arg.name: Forall([], arg_tyvar)}
        body_subst, body_ty = infer_w(expr.body, body_ctx)
        return body_subst, TyCon("->", [apply_ty(arg_tyvar, body_subst), body_ty])
    if isinstance(expr, Apply):
        s1, ty = infer_w(expr.func, ctx)
        s2, p = infer_w(expr.arg, apply_ctx(ctx, s1))
        r = fresh_tyvar()
        s3 = unify_w(apply_ty(ty, s2), TyCon("->", [p, r]))
        return compose(compose(s3, s2), s1), apply_ty(r, s3)
    if isinstance(expr, Where):
        name, value, body = expr.binding.name.name, expr.binding.value, expr.body
        s1, ty1 = infer_w(value, ctx)
        ctx1 = dict(ctx)  # copy
        ctx1.pop(name, None)
        ctx2 = {**ctx, name: Forall([], ty1)}
        s2, ty2 = infer_w(body, apply_ctx(ctx2, s1))
        return compose(s2, s1), ty2
    raise TypeError(f"Unexpected type {type(expr)}")
```

## Algorithm M

TODO

https://www.classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2007/spring/32001-1/papers/p707-lee.pdf

Pass in a type variable? Annotate the AST?

Top-down (upside-down W, ha ha)

## Algorithm J

Alright, so substitutions are a little clunky. Maybe there's a neat way to do
this in functional languages by threading the state through automatically or
something, but we're in Python and I'm a bit of a programming caveman, so we're
doing side effects.

Unlike Algorithm W, which builds up a map of substitutions, Algorithm J uses
union-find on the type variables to store equivalences. (I wrote about
Union-find previously in my intro to [Vectorizing ML
models](/blog/vectorizing-ml-models/).)

We have to add the usual `forwarded`/`find`/`make_equal_to` infrastructure to
the types we defined above.

```python
@dataclasses.dataclass
class MonoType:
    forwarded: MonoType | None = dataclasses.field(init=False, default=None)

    def find(self) -> MonoType:
        result: MonoType = self
        while isinstance(result, TyVar):
            it = result.forwarded
            if it is None:
                return result
            result = it
        return result

    def _set_forwarded(self, other: MonoType) -> None:
        raise NotImplementedError


@dataclasses.dataclass
class TyVar(MonoType):
    name: str

    def make_equal_to(self, other: MonoType) -> None:
        self.find()._set_forwarded(other)

    def _set_forwarded(self, other: MonoType) -> None:
        self.forwarded = other


@dataclasses.dataclass
class TyCon(MonoType):
    name: str
    args: list[MonoType]
```

While it doesn't really make sense to `find` or `make_equal_to` on a type
constructor (it should always be a leaf in the union-find DAG), we still define
`find` and `_set_forwarded` to make MyPy happy and make some code look a little
more natural.

Once we do that, we can write our unify implementation for Algorithm J. You can
see that the general structure has not changed much, but the recursive bits
in the `TyCon` case have gotten much simpler to read.

<!-- TODO: occurs check -->

```python
def unify_j(ty1: MonoType, ty2: MonoType) -> None:
    ty1 = ty1.find()
    ty2 = ty2.find()
    if isinstance(ty1, TyVar):
        ty1.make_equal_to(ty2)
        return
    if isinstance(ty2, TyVar):  # Mirror
        return unify_j(ty2, ty1)
    if isinstance(ty1, TyCon) and isinstance(ty2, TyCon):
        if ty1.name != ty2.name:
            unify_fail(ty1, ty2)
        if len(ty1.args) != len(ty2.args):
            unify_fail(ty1, ty2)
        for l, r in zip(ty1.args, ty2.args):
            unify_j(l, r)
        return
    raise TypeError(f"Unexpected type {type(ty1)}")
```

Now that we have unify (which, remember, makes side-effecty changes using
`make_equal_to`), we can write our infer function. It will look pretty similar
to Algorithm J in overall structure, and in fact our plaintext algorithm
applies just as well.

The main difference is that we invent a new type variable for every AST node
and unify it with some expected type. I don't think this is strictly necessary
(we don't need a type variable to return `IntType` for int literals, for
example), but I think it makes for easier reading. If I were to slim it down a
bit, I think the rule I would use is "only invent a type variable if it needs
to be constrained in the type of something else". Like in `Apply`.

```python
def infer_j(expr: Object, ctx: Context) -> TyVar:
    result = fresh_tyvar()
    if isinstance(expr, Var):
        scheme = ctx.get(expr.name)
        if scheme is None:
            raise TypeError(f"Unbound variable {expr.name}")
        unify_j(result, scheme.ty)
        return result
    if isinstance(expr, Int):
        unify_j(result, IntType)
        return result
    if isinstance(expr, Function):
        arg_tyvar = fresh_tyvar("a")
        assert isinstance(expr.arg, Var)
        body_ctx = {**ctx, expr.arg.name: Forall([], arg_tyvar)}
        body_ty = infer_j(expr.body, body_ctx)
        unify_j(result, TyCon("->", [arg_tyvar, body_ty]))
        return result
    if isinstance(expr, Apply):
        func_ty = infer_j(expr.func, ctx)
        arg_ty = infer_j(expr.arg, ctx)
        unify_j(func_ty, TyCon("->", [arg_ty, result]))
        return result
    if isinstance(expr, Where):
        name, value, body = expr.binding.name.name, expr.binding.value, expr.body
        value_ty = infer_j(value, ctx)
        body_ty = infer_j(body, {**ctx, name: Forall([], value_ty)})
        unify_j(result, body_ty)
        return result
    raise TypeError(f"Unexpected type {type(expr)}")
```

There you have it. Algorithm J: looks like W, but simpler and (apparently)
faster.

This concludes the section on basic HM. I don't think any in-use language uses
HM like this; they all build on extensions. We have added some of these
extensions to make Scrapscript's type system more expressive.

## Extensions for Scrapscript

<!--
Adding type system features that go beyond HM in terms of expressivity often
requires some type annotations from the programmer, or adding significant
complexity to the inference algorithm.
-->

### Let polymorphism

The first quality of life feature that people tend to add, I think, is some
kind of polymorphism. We alluded to it earlier because it was already baked
into our implementation (and we had to scratch it out temporarily to write the
post), and we're coming back to it now.

In order to make polymorphism decidable (I think), you have to pick some
limited set of points in the concrete syntax to generalize types. The usual
place is in `let` bindings. This is why all `let`-bound program variables
(including top-level definitions) are associated with *type schemes* in the
context. I think you could also do it with a `generalize` or `template` keyword
or something, but people tend to use `let` as the signal.

The change to the inference algorithm is as follows:

* if you see a let binding `let n = v in b` (called "where" in scrapscript) `e`,
  * infer the type of the value `v`
  * **generalize `type(v)` to get a scheme `s`**
  * add `n: s` to the environment while type checking the body `b`
  * return `type(b)`

Note that even though we generalize the type to store it into the environment,
we *still return a monotype*.

Hindley Milner types also include a `forall` quantifier that allows for some
amount of polymorphism. Consider the function `id = x -> x`. The type of `id`
is `forall 'a. 'a -> 'a`. This is kind of like a lambda for type variables. The
`forall` construct binds type variables like normal lambdas bind normal
variables. Some of the literature calls these *type schemes*.

Generalize is kind of like the opposite of instantiate. It takes a type and
turns it into a scheme using its free variables:

```python
def generalize(ty: MonoType, ctx: Context) -> Forall: ...
```

For example, generalizing `'a` would be `forall 'a. 'a`. Or generalizing `'a
list -> int` would result in `forall 'a. 'a list -> int` (the type scheme of
the list `length` function).

You can't directly use a type scheme, a `Forall`, in a type expression.
Instead, you have to *instantiate* (similar to "call" or "apply") the `Forall`.
This replaces the bound variables ("parameters") with new variables in the
right hand side---in the type. For example, instantiating `forall 'a. 'a -> 'a`
might give you `'t123 -> 't123`, where `'t123` is a fresh variable.

```python
def instantiate(scheme: Forall) -> MonoType: ...
```

Now, to integrate let polymorphism into our Algorithm J inference engine, we
need only change two lines:

```python
def infer_j(expr: Object, ctx: Context) -> TyVar:
    # ...
    if isinstance(expr, Var):
        scheme = ctx.get(expr.name)
        if scheme is None:
            raise TypeError(f"Unbound variable {expr.name}")
        unify_j(result, instantiate(scheme))  # changed!
        return result
    if isinstance(expr, Where):
        name, value, body = expr.binding.name.name, expr.binding.value, expr.body
        value_ty = infer_j(value, ctx)
        value_scheme = generalize(recursive_find(value_ty), ctx)  # changed!
        body_ty = infer_j(body, {**ctx, name: value_scheme})
        unify_j(result, body_ty)
        return result
    # ...
```

Note that due to our union-find implementation, we also need to do this
"recursive find" thing that calls `.find()` recursively to discover all of the
type variables in the type. Otherwise we might just see `'t0` as our only free
type variable or something.

### Recursion

Another quality of life feature that people tend to want in programming
languages, especially programming languages without loops, is recursion. Right
now our infer function won't support functions referring to themselves; we
don't add the function name to the environment when running inference on the
function body.

To add a limited form of recursion, we do the following:

* if typing the pattern `f = FUNCTION` or `f = MATCH_FUNCTION`,
  * then bind `f` to some new type variable to "tie the knot" in
    the context

```python
def infer_j(expr: Object, ctx: Context) -> TyVar:
    # ...
    if isinstance(expr, Where):
        name, value, body = expr.binding.name.name, expr.binding.value, expr.body
        if isinstance(value, Function):
            # Letrec
            func_ty = fresh_tyvar()
            value_ty = infer_j(value, {**ctx, name: Forall([], func_ty)})
        else:
            # Let
            value_ty = infer_j(value, ctx)
        # ...
```

This is helpful, but it's not a full solution. OCaml, for example, has `let
rec`/`and` to write mutually recursive functions. We don't have the syntax to
express that in Scrapscript.

In an ideal world, we would have a way to type mutual recursion anyway. I think
this involves identifying call graphs and strongly connected components within
those graphs. Sounds trickier than it's worth right now[^cfa].

[^cfa]: But control flow analysis (CFA) is on my TODO list anyway, so...

### More datatypes

Scrapscript has lists. While Scrapscript allows for heterogeneous lists
(a list can contain elements of different types at the same time), our type
system will not (at least to start). In order to type these lists, we need to
constrain all the list elements to be the same type when we see a list
constructor.

```python
def infer_j(expr: Object, ctx: Context) -> TyVar:
    # ...
    if isinstance(expr, List):
        list_item_ty = fresh_tyvar()
        for item in expr.items:
            item_ty = infer_j(item, ctx)
            unify_j(list_item_ty, item_ty)
        return TyCon("list", [list_item_ty])
```

This means that an empty list will have type `'a list`. And, interestingly
enough, a `let`-bound empty list will have type scheme `forall 'a. 'a list`.

### Pattern matching

What's the type of a match case pattern? Until a couple of days ago, I didn't
know. Turns out, it's the type that it looks like it should be, as long as you
bind all the variables in the pattern to fresh type variables.

For example, the type of `| [x, y] -> x` is `'a list -> 'a` because the list
constructor tells us this should be a list. But in order to avoid raising
an `Unbound variable` exception when we see `x` in the pattern, we have to
prefill the context with `x` bound to a fresh type variable.

Similarly, the type of `| [x, 5] -> x` is `int list -> int` because the `5`
literal makes the whole thing an `int list`. This means that we gain additional
type information about `x` too!

Let's look at the Python code for inferring a singular match case:

```python
def infer_j(expr: Object, ctx: Context) -> TyVar:
    # ...
    if isinstance(expr, MatchCase):
        pattern_ctx = collect_vars_in_pattern(expr.pattern)
        body_ctx = {**ctx, **pattern_ctx}
        pattern_ty = infer_j(expr.pattern, body_ctx)
        body_ty = infer_j(expr.body, body_ctx)
        unify_j(result, func_type(pattern_ty, body_ty))
        return result
```

Then for an entire match function, we unify all of the case functions to make
the pattern types line up and the return types line up.

```python
def infer_j(expr: Object, ctx: Context) -> TyVar:
    # ...
    if isinstance(expr, MatchFunction):
        for case in expr.cases:
            case_ty = infer_j(case, ctx)
            unify_j(result, case_ty)
        return result
```

Similar to typing lists, match patterns have to (for now?) be homogeneous. That
means that the following snippet of code, which is perfectly legal Scrapscript,
wouldn't fly with our type inference:

```
| [x] -> x
| {a=1} -> 2
```

It would be nice to support this but I don't know how right now.

(Also remember to add `MatchFunction` to the type check in the recursive
`let`!)

### Row polymorphism

Scrapscript has records (kind of like structs) and run-time row polymorphism.
This means that you can have a function that pulls out a field from a record
and any record with that field is a legal argument to the function.

See for example two different looking records (2D point and 3D point):

```
get_x left + get_x right
. left  = { x = 1, y = 2 }
. right = { x = 1, y = 2, z = 3 }
. get_x = | { x = x, ... } -> x
```

Hindley Milner doesn't come with support for this right out of the box. If you
add support for records, then you end up with a more rigid system: the records
have to have the same number of fields and same names of fields and same types
of fields. This is safe but overly restrictive.

I think it's possible to "easily" add row polymorphism but we haven't done it
yet. Finding a simple, distilled version of the ideas in the papers has so far
been elusive.
