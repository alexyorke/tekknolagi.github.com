title: WebAssembly compilers for free with weval

[Chris Fallin](https://cfallin.org/) came and gave a talk to the Northeastern
[Programming Research Laboratory](https://prl.khoury.northeastern.edu/)
yesterday. He talked about his work on a new project called
[weval](https://github.com/cfallin/weval), a WebAssembly partial evaluator.

Partial evaluation is neat. In short, it's all about taking an existing
program, modifying it to hold some of its inputs as constants, and then letting
the compiler/optimizer go hog wild on it. The result is still a program---not a
value---and it's usually faster than the original program.

weval does that for entire WebAssembly modules. You might want to use it if,
for example, your WebAssembly module is an interpreter. Imagine a world where
you have compiled a runtime such as SpiderMonkey or CPython to WebAssembly. You
could then run your Python or JavaScript programs on the WebAssembly runtime,
but they would be slower than if you had compiled them directly to WebAssembly.
