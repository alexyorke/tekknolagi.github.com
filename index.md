<h1>I'm Max Bernstein.</h1>

I am a human and [programmer](https://github.com/tekknolagi). I like to read
books, take photos, and ride bikes in the hills near my house. I [tweet
things](https://twitter.com/tekknolagi) (and [toot
things](https://mastodon.social/@tekknolagi)) about bread, legumes, and
compilers. I am currently a PhD student at Northeastern University. <span
markdown="1" class="newlink">**Hire me! I am looking for a dynamic language
runtimes or compilers job.**</span>

You can [email me](mailto:contact@bernsteinbear.com) if you so desire. I'm
happy to talk about education, programming languages, cycling, and more.

## I like making things.

That's probably an understatement. Here are some of my favorite projects:

* [scrapscript.py](https://github.com/tekknolagi/scrapscript), an
  implementation of the ScrapScript language. Check out the [blog
  post](/blog/scrapscript) too
* [Cinder](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder), Instagram's
  performance-oriented fork of CPython---try it out on
  [trycinder.com](https://trycinder.com) (which I built!)
* [Skybison](https://github.com/tekknolagi/skybison) (fork of
  [original](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/skybison)), Instagram's
  performance-oriented greenfield implementation of Python
* [shru.gg](https://shru.gg), a website built just so I would have to stop
  finding, copying, and pasting that shrug emoji. If you like it, you are
  welcome [to help keep it running](https://github.com/sponsors/tekknolagi)
* An [Lisp to x86-64 compiler](https://github.com/tekknolagi/ghuloum) I wrote
  in C and accompanying [blog posts](/blog/lisp/)
* The [term paper](/dat-paper/) I wrote for COMP 117 IDS
  analyzing Dat and the Beaker browser
* [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/), a compiler front-end and toolchain for
  OCaml
* The [final project spec [PDF]](/resources/comp15-homework6.pdf)
  and reference implementation (2016) and
  [independent project spec [PDF]](/resources/comp15-independent.pdf)
  (2016) for the data structures course I TAed
* A [distributed ray tracer](https://github.com/TheiaRT/tracer) (2015) that I
  made with friends for a concurrent programming course, with the
  [final writeup [PDF]](/resources/comp50-writeup.pdf)

I like making things [just for fun](https://justforfunnoreally.dev/).

## I like teaching.

* I taught [CS 50ISDT](/isdt/) (2021), a course [Tom](https://tchebb.me/) and I
  wrote for Tufts about software development tooling
* I taught [EXP 57](/excollege/) (2018), a course
  [Yuki](https://yzan424.github.io/) and I wrote for Tufts about personal and
  professional development
* I TAed CS 4530 at Northeastern (Fall 2023)
* I TAed CS 11 (intro), 15 (data structures), 40 (machine structure), and
  Concurrent Programming at Tufts and was the head TA for 11 and 15

## Sometimes I contribute to open source projects.

* [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/)
  ([!848](https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/merge_requests/848),
  [!858](https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/merge_requests/858))
* [Cinder](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder)
* [Skybison](https://github.com/tekknolagi/skybison)
  (fork of [original](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/skybison))
* [YJIT](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby)
  ([#58](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby/pull/58),
   [#59](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby/pull/59)),
  which now lives in [upstream Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby)
* [CPython](https://www.python.org/)
  ([bpo-36929](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/13392),
  [bpo-38648](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/17002),
  [bpo-42065](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/19940),
  [bpo-42199](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/23031),
  [faster-cpython #546](https://github.com/faster-cpython/ideas/issues/546))
* [Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/)
  ([Refactor protocol inference](https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check/commit/f14577db5940c0b4087fffe209786cd4075f37df))
* [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)
  ([rC345558](https://reviews.llvm.org/rC345558))
* [Reason](https://github.com/facebook/reason)

Fun fact: I have now contributed to five different Python runtimes (Skybison,
Cinder, CPython, PyPy, and Pyjion).

## I will happily talk in front of people.

* [*Compiling ML models*](/assets/img/compiling-ml-models.pdf) (PDF) at NEU Software Day 2023
* [*Cinder: We didn't start the fire*](/assets/img/ecoop2022.pdf) (PDF) at [ECOOP 2022](https://2022.ecoop.org/details/ICOOOLPS-2022-papers/5/Cinder-We-didn-t-start-the-fire) (invited talk)
* *How Git works* at Tufts PolyHack 2019

## I have some fun facts.

* I [adopted the Person Biking emoji ðŸš´](https://twitter.com/unicode/status/1341803011501223936).
* I once biked across Germany (TÃ¼bingen to Puttgarden).
* I walked the entire [Walking City Trail](https://www.bostontrails.org/) in
  one day. It took 10 hours of moving time and 2 hours of eating time.
